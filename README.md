Alarm Clock
This is an alarm clock project that allows users to set and delete alarms. The clock displays the current time and rings an alarm when a set time is reached.

Features
Set and delete alarms
Display current time and day date
Ring an alarm at a set time

Technologies I have used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Honourable mentioning
"Animate.css" for the animation stuff.
"Bootstrap: for providing the icons.

Usage
Set the alarm time by selecting the hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM using the dropdown menus.
Click the "Set Alarm" button to set the alarm.
The alarm will ring when the set time is reached.
To delete an alarm, click the "Delete" button next to the alarm in the alarm list.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Persu1t/Alarm-Clock.git

Changes are welcome.
For the future I wnat that the alarm should ring on specific day or Alarm should only go on the selected day/days.
And should use sound to alert the user rather than the javascript "Alert".
